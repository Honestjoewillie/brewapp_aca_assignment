# Brew App Lookup - Terminal

### Project Description:

This is a terminal app we created using node.js and the BreweryDB API, as part of assignment for Austin Coding Academy. This app will allow you to type any zipcode into the terminal, when prompted, and it will fetch breweries available in the API based on the zipcode. 

### Project Notes:

1. Once you clone the repo, you will need to type <blockquote>npm install<blockquote> in your terminal to download all dependecies
2. This project utilizes a .env to encrypt our API KEY - if you want to use the app, sign up for a free sandbox API at https://www.brewerydb.com/developers
3. This is a terminal app so once all dependencies are downloaded use <blockquote>node brewapp.js<blockquote> in your terminal to begin using the app
